# Threat Model

This document describes the security properties and known limitations of the
`stream` contract. Read it before deciding how much value to lock.

## Design goals

The contract is intentionally minimal. It holds tokens on behalf of two
parties and enforces a linear release schedule. No administrator account
exists. No upgrade path is built in. The contract deployed to a given address
is the contract that will run for the lifetime of that address.

## No pause mechanism

**The contract has no pause, freeze, or emergency-stop function.**

There is no owner, admin, or multisig that can halt withdrawals, block a
sender's cancel, or prevent any other operation. Once a stream is created the
only parties that can affect it are the original sender (cancel) and the
original recipient (withdraw).

### Why this matters

Soroban contracts are immutable after deployment. If a bug is discovered in
the vesting logic, the token-transfer path, or any other part of the contract,
there is no mechanism to:

- stop new funds from being exposed to the vulnerability,
- freeze in-flight streams while a fix is prepared, or
- migrate locked tokens to a patched contract.

Every token locked in a stream is therefore exposed to any bug that exists in
the deployed bytecode for the full duration of that stream.

### Consequence for users

Anyone considering a long-duration stream — multi-month vesting schedules,
multi-year grants, subscription arrangements — should treat the contract's
audit status and the amount they are willing to lock as directly linked. A
stream that cannot be paused or migrated is a commitment whose risk profile
does not improve after the fact.

The sender's `cancel` function is the only unilateral escape hatch. It returns
the unvested portion to the sender, but it does not recover tokens that have
already vested to the recipient. If a bug affects the cancel path itself,
neither party has further recourse through the contract.

### Why no pause was added

A pause mechanism requires a privileged account. Introducing one would create
a new attack surface: the key that holds pause authority becomes a high-value
target, and its compromise would let an attacker freeze every stream on the
contract simultaneously. The design trades operational flexibility for the
removal of that privileged-key risk. This is an explicit choice, not an
oversight.

## Immutability

The contract bytecode is fixed at the Wasm hash recorded on-chain at
deployment. There is no `upgrade` entry point. A bug fix requires deploying a
new contract instance; existing streams do not move automatically.

## Authorization model

Every state-changing operation is guarded by Soroban's `require_auth()`. Only
the `sender` may call `cancel`; only the `recipient` may call `withdraw` or
`withdraw_amount`. No other account, including any deployer or admin, holds
any authority over a stream after it is created.

## Invariants

These properties must hold after every successful call. A reviewer checking a
change to `contract.rs`, `vesting.rs`, or `storage.rs` should confirm each one
still holds rather than re-reading the whole contract from scratch.

- **A stream's escrow never exceeds its `total_amount`, and `withdrawn` never
  exceeds `total_amount`.** `create_stream` deposits exactly `total_amount`
  from the sender before the record is written (`contract.rs`,
  `create_stream`). Every later payout — `withdraw`, `withdraw_amount`, and
  the refund in `cancel` — is sized from `vesting::withdrawable_amount` or
  `vesting::settlement`, both of which derive from `vested_amount`, which is
  itself clamped to `[0, total_amount]` (`vesting.rs`). No path adds to
  `total_amount` or transfers more than the vested-but-unwithdrawn balance.
- **`withdrawn` only increases.** `withdraw_with` is the only writer of this
  field (`contract.rs`) and always does `stream.withdrawn += amount` with a
  non-negative `amount`; nothing ever decrements or resets it.
- **A cancelled stream never vests further, and cannot be cancelled again.**
  `cancel` freezes the schedule at the moment of cancellation — `total_amount`
  is cut down to the vested amount and `end_time` is set to `now`
  (`contract.rs`, `cancel`) — so `vested_amount` for any later `now` returns
  the same, already-frozen total. The leading `if stream.cancelled { return
  Err(StreamError::AlreadyCancelled) }` check makes a second `cancel` a no-op
  error rather than a second refund.
- **Only the sender may cancel; only the recipient may withdraw.** Enforced by
  `stream.sender.require_auth()` in `cancel` and
  `stream.recipient.require_auth()` in `withdraw_with` (the shared body of
  `withdraw` and `withdraw_amount`). No other entry point authorizes against
  a stream's stored `sender`/`recipient`.
- **A stream id is issued at most once and never reused.** `create_stream`
  reads `storage::stream_count`, uses that value as the new id, and advances
  the counter with a checked increment that returns
  `StreamError::StreamCountExhausted` instead of wrapping
  (`contract.rs`, `create_stream`; `storage.rs`).
- **`total_amount` is always positive and within `MAX_AMOUNT`.** Checked once,
  at creation, before any token moves (`contract.rs`, `create_stream`,
  `total_amount <= 0` / `total_amount > MAX_AMOUNT`). Nothing after creation
  can change `total_amount` except `cancel` reducing it downward to the
  vested amount.
- **`cliff_time` always falls within `[start_time, end_time]`, and
  `start_time < end_time`.** Both are checked at creation
  (`contract.rs`, `create_stream`) and never modified afterward except by
  `cancel`, which only ever moves them earlier or equal (`start_time.min(now)`,
  `cliff_time.min(now)`), never outside that relative order.

## Trust assumptions about the token contract

`create_stream` accepts a caller-supplied `token: Address` with no allowlist,
and every stream stores it: `withdraw`, `withdraw_amount`, and `cancel` all
invoke that same address later, on the caller's behalf, for the life of the
stream.

**What is assumed.** The token behaves as a conforming SEP-41 (or Stellar
Asset Contract) token: `transfer` moves exactly the requested amount between
the two accounts named, does not charge an undisclosed fee, does not itself
call back into this contract, and either succeeds or fails atomically with no
partial effect. The stream contract does not re-check the resulting balances
after a transfer; it trusts the token's own accounting.

**What a hostile or broken token can do.** Because the token is invoked with
the stream contract's own authority (the contract is the token's caller for
outgoing transfers), a token that violates these assumptions can affect that
stream's participants:

- **Silent short-transfer or an undisclosed fee.** A token that sends less
  than the requested amount without erroring would let a withdrawal report
  success while the recipient received less than the vesting math promised.
  Stream accounting (`withdrawn`, `total_amount`) is unaffected by the actual
  transferred amount, only by what was requested.
- **Reentrancy.** A token whose `transfer` invokes back into this contract
  (for example, from a hook on the recipient) executes before this contract's
  own state write completes for `create_stream` (transfer precedes the write)
  but after it for `withdraw`/`withdraw_amount`/`cancel` (see the ordering
  note below) — a reentrant call in the latter case would read `stream.withdrawn`
  already updated for the in-flight withdrawal, so a second, concurrent
  withdrawal of the same accrued balance is not possible. It could still
  interleave with the schedule (e.g., trigger a `cancel`) in ways not exercised
  by the test suite.
- **A token that never returns / always fails.** Every stream created with
  that token becomes permanently illiquid — no `withdraw`, `withdraw_amount`,
  or `cancel` can complete, because each aborts the whole call the same way
  any other transfer failure does (see below). The tokens already deposited
  stay in the contract, unreachable by either party, for as long as the
  chosen token remains broken.

**Who is responsible.** The contract enforces no allowlist and performs no
token-quality checks beyond confirming the address responds to a transfer
call. Choosing a token is entirely the sender's decision, made at
`create_stream` time; the contract offers no protection against a
malicious or defective one, and neither party can change the token on an
existing stream.

## What happens when a token transfer fails

`withdraw`, `withdraw_amount`, `cancel`, and `create_stream`'s initial deposit
all call the token's `transfer` through the plain (non-`try_`) client method
(`contract.rs`, the internal `transfer` helper and `create_stream`). If the
token contract returns an error or traps, that call itself traps, and Soroban
aborts the whole host invocation: **the entire transaction is rolled back, not
just the transfer.** Any storage write this contract made earlier in the same
call — the new stream record in `create_stream`, the incremented `withdrawn`
in `withdraw`/`withdraw_amount`, the frozen schedule in `cancel` — is undone
along with it, because a Soroban invocation only commits state if it returns
successfully. There is no path that leaves `withdrawn` incremented, or a
stream marked `cancelled`, while the corresponding transfer never happened.

**What the caller should do.** A failed transfer surfaces as a failed
transaction, not a typed `StreamError` — the failure is the token's, not this
contract's, so there is no `StreamError` variant for it. The caller should
inspect the failed transaction's diagnostic events to see which token call
failed and why (insufficient balance, no trustline, a frozen asset, or the
token contract's own error), resolve that condition, and retry the same
call: since nothing was committed, retrying is safe and not a double-spend.

## Out-of-scope risks

The following risks exist but are outside the scope of this contract:

- **Token contract bugs.** The streamed token is an external contract. A
  vulnerability in that contract can affect transfers regardless of stream
  contract correctness.
- **Stellar network-level events.** Ledger upgrades, validator behaviour, and
  protocol changes are outside this contract's control.
- **Key compromise.** If a sender's or recipient's private key is compromised,
  the attacker can cancel or drain the stream as that party.
- **Front-running.** Because Stellar transactions are publicly visible before
  inclusion, a recipient could theoretically race a cancel transaction, though
  the window is narrow and the vesting math caps what can be withdrawn.
